# Simple Binary Wavelet transform + Chebyshev map

This application implements the Binary Wavelet Transform combined with the Chebyshev Map and works only on single-channel images.

## Recommended Environment

It is recommended to use Python 12.5 for compatibility and optimal performance.

## Execution

*1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:*

``` 
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
 ```
*2. Install Dependencies:*

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

After:

Use the bwt_tests notebook to run encryption and your cryptographic tests.
You can also use the aes_tests notebook to make comparisons with the proposed algorithm.

## Troubleshooting
If issues arise, adjust the pyzmq package version:
```
python -m pip uninstall pyzmq
pip install pyzmq==25.1.2
```
